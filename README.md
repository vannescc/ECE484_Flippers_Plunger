# ECE484_Flippers_Plunger
Flippers, and plunger for ECE 484 final pinball project. Individual portion.

## Flippers
The flippers will be driven by servo motors and triggered by push button potentiometers on the side of the pinball machine. Ensuring that the servo motors can withstand enough torque to launch the balls will be challenging.

## Plunger
The plunger will be purely mechanical and spring loaded with rubber bands.
