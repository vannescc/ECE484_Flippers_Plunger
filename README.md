# ECE484_Flippers_Plunger_BallReturn
Flippers, plunger, and ball return for ECE 484 final pinball project. Individual portion.

##Flippers
The flippers will be driven by servo motors and triggered by push button potentiometers on the side of the pinball machine. Ensuring that the servo motors can withstand enough torque to launch the balls will be challenging.

##Plunger
The plunger will be purely mechanical and spring loaded with rubber bands.

##Ball Return
The ball return will be driven by gravity into a gate controlled by a stepper motor. The ball return will only return balls under certain conditions, such as scoring a goal.
